## This project is a work in progress. If you want to contact me, do it at XXX.
This is a small project that I put together to make a custom tag selector notion style. It was born while I was working on another project, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Ailer-h/library_of_alexandria).

Note that this project needs a server to work. I intend on deploying a demo that works exclusively without php, but as I haven't finished the main functionality yet, I'll leave it to the future.

## Used technologies.

- HTML and CSS;
- PHP;
- SQL
- JavaScript;
- JQuery.

## Used softwares.

- Git - Version Control;
- VSCode - Code Editing;
- phpMyAdmin - Database management.
